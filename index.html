                <h2>Hatha Yoga</h2>
                <p>Hatha yoga is generally practiced slowly and with static posture holds than found in other styles.
                    Hatha yoga has become associated solely with a physical practice, typically involving a sequence of 
                    asana (yoga postures) and pranayama (breathing techniques).

                <div class="left-offerings-heading">
                    <h2>Iyengar Yoga</h2>
                    <p>Iyengar yoga stemmed from the Hatha yoga tradition. Iyengar yoga is a disciplined system with carefully planned and 
                    timed sequences. Often, props, such as blocks and belts, are used to ensure students can practice the 
                    postures with correct alignment and safely develop their yoga practice over time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="left-offerings-heading">
                    <h2>Kundalini Yoga</h2>
                    <p>Kundalini yoga is also called the "yoga of awareness." The primary aim of Kundalini yoga is to awaken the kundalini energy, 
                    which lies coiled, serpent-like, at the base of the spine. In Kundalini yoga, practitioners use breathing exercises, physical 
                    postures, chanting and meditation to unlock this energy.</p>

            <div class="right-offerings-heading">
                <h2>Guided Meditation</h2>
                <p>Guided meditations are usually well-structured, and follow a relatively simple step-by-step format. Generally, teachers will 
                    explain a little about how the mind works, and how to calm it, before leading you through the sequential steps of a specific 
                    meditation technique.

            </div>
            <div class="right-offerings-heading">
                <h2>Chakra Meditation</h2>
                <p>Chakra meditation is a form of meditation intended to activate, open and balance the seven chakras. Chakra meditation can be 
                    practiced to improve general well-being or to address specific issues with one or more chakras that are thought to be blocked 
                    or out of alignment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right-offerings-heading">
                <h2>Qigong Meditation</h2>
                <p>Qigong is a traditional Chinese system of postures, movement and meditation that is practiced to promote health, well-being and 
                    spiritual development. Like many types of yoga, it has an emphasis on coordinating breath with movement , but it is actually 
                    more closely related to Tai Chi.</p>
