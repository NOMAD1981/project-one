        <h2>Kundalini Yoga</h2>
        <p>Kundalini yoga is also called the "yoga of awareness." The primary aim of Kundalini yoga is to awaken the kundalini energy, 
          which lies coiled, serpent-like, at the base of the spine. In Kundalini yoga, practitioners use breathing, physical 
          postures, chanting and meditation to unlock this energy.</p>

          meditation technique. </p>
